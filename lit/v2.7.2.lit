\note{fix}{
  A feature originally intended for 2.8.0 snuck in to 2.7.1 and caused
  breakage around SSL communication. We've disabled it by default. Sorry
  about that!

  We'll do more extensive testing for this feature by the time it makes it to
  2.8.0.
}

\note{feature}{
  The connection to Postgres can now be configured with SSL. Along the way
  we've also broken the single opaque \code{--postgres-datasource} flag on
  the \code{web} binary into multiple more descriptive flags, which should
  make it easier to discover what you can or should configure. To see the
  flags, consult \code{web --help}.

  Note that the binaries still default \code{--postgres-sslmode} to
  \code{disable} for backwards-compatibility. Unfortunately the configuration
  value of \code{prefer} is not available in our Postgres DB driver of
  choice, so it was either require SSL by default in all configurations
  (which would be unreasonable for small local deployments) or just leave it
  off by default.

  The BOSH release has always been configured via discrete properties, rather
  than a single DataSource, and now has a \code{postgresql.ca_cert} property
  among others. Consult
  \link{bosh.io}{http://bosh.io/jobs/atc?source=github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-release&version=2.7.1#p=postgresql}
  for more information.

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a couple quirks related to our security fixes that affected folks
  with colons or any other funny characters in their pipeline names. Moral of
  the story: never use a regexp if you can help it. Also, y'all have weird
  pipeline names.
