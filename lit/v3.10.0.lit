\warn{
  Users upgrading to v3.10.0 with BOSH have reported issues where baggageclaim
  will not start after the upgrade. This issue has been reported and fixed for future versions
  of Concourse. In the meantime, you can workaround the problem by using the
  workaround described in \link{#2125}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/2125#issuecomment-378711617}
}
\note{breaking}{
  This release involves a worker protocol version bump, from \code{1.3} to
  \code{2.0}, and also switches the default
  \reference{component-baggageclaim} driver back to \code{btrfs}. Read on for
  more information!

  We recommend spinning up a new pool of \reference{worker-node}s, upgrading
  your \reference{web-node}s, and then removing the old workers. Otherwise
  your workers may get swarmed with containers, if only one \code{2.0} worker
  is added at a time with the web nodes already upgraded.
}

\note{feature,breaking}{
  The \code{concourse} worker commands can now be pointed at
  \italic{multiple} \reference{component-tsa} addresses, rather than one, so
  that it can retry against a random node each time. As part of this, we've
  removed the \code{--tsa-port} flag and changed \code{--tsa-host} to instead
  take a \code{host:port}. (Because
  \link{TECHNICALLY}{images/technically.gif}, they could be on different
  ports.)
}

\note{feature}{
  We've revamped how \reference{fly-execute} gets its inputs and outputs
  to/from the build, so that configuring the \reference{component-atc} with
  an external URL is no longer required. See \ghissue{2069} for the
  nitty-gritty.
}

\note{feature,breaking}{
  We've switched back to \code{btrfs} as the default driver. We switched away
  in \ghrelease{v3.1.0} in the midst of a ton of stability issues, which we
  have think we've fixed in \ghrelease{v3.9.0}.

  This resolves a long-standing performance issue when using privileged tasks
  or resource types (like the \resource{docker-image}). For more information,
  see \ghissue{1404} and \ghissue{1966}.

  Be sure to use the latest possible kernel version so that you have a
  \code{btrfs} with the latest fixes. We suspect that this will still be an
  occasional issue, though far less frequent.
}

\note{fix}{
  Previously, \reference{resource-type-tags} on a resource type didn't get no
  respect. They are now respected.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed an \reference{component-atc} crash that would occur when a
  \reference{task-step} errored with the next step using an
  \reference{attempts-step-modifier}.
}

\note{feature}{
  The \code{concourse} binary (and Docker image) now supports a
  \code{quickstart} command, which will spin up an itty bitty Concourse
  cluster with a single worker.
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{docker-image} now supports pushing multiple tags, thanks to a
  combined effort of \ghuser{gcmalloc} and \ghuser{jerith}!
}

\note{feature}{
  When the \reference{component-atc} is streaming data between workers, the
  stream will now be \code{gzip}-compressed, which should speed things up
  quite a bit. (This is what caused the worker version bump to \code{2.0}.)
}

\note{feature,security}{
  The \reference{component-atc} now requires TLS v1.2+ and a \link{stricter
  set of cipher
  suites}{https://github.com/concourse/atc/blob/ed08aa96b357a19a6dca08608108cb6e07735aa7/atccmd/command.go#L703-L707}.
  Say that five times fast!
}

\note{fix}{
  Concourse now supports the newer \code{umask}-hardened BOSH stemcells
  (v3541.x).
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a botched \code{bash}ism that led to the \resource{docker-image} to
  exit early on certain environments (more info
  \link{here}{https://github.com/concourse/docker-image-resource/issues/170}).
}

\note{fix}{
  Cleaned up a noisy PostgreSQL error that would occur on start when checking
  for the legacy \code{migration_version} table.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a UI glitch that caused the last line to be misaligned with the
  timestamps if it had no trailing linebreak.
