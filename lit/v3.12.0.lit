\warn{
  A bug was introduced in \code{build-reaper} under ATC/web that
  causes old build logs to accumulate in Concourse (\ghissue{2187}).
}
\warn{
  \bold{Jun 1, 2018}
  A bug in Chrome 67 causes it to crash when loading the Concourse UI.
  At the time of this notice, the dev/canary versions of Google Chrome should
  work, as well as other browsers like Firefox and Safari.
  You can follow along the issue in \ghissue{2236}
}
\note{feature,breaking}{
  The \reference{component-atc} will now batch-delete containers and volumes,
  rather than making individual calls out to the worker. This is an
  incremental step towards \ghissue{1959} that should reduce the network/IO
  overhead on the ATC during garbage collection.

  \warn{
    This requires a new port to be reachable on the \reference{worker-node}
    from the \reference{web-node}: \code{7799}. This communication will go away
    once we fully complete parallel GC, as the workers will ask the web nodes
    what to delete instead.
  }
}

\note{feature,breaking}{
  In \ghrelease{v3.11.0} we changed the default behavior of the
  \resource{git} so that it does not fetch tags by default. In hindsight we
  should have been a bit more careful here, as many people depend on that
  behavior. We've decided to roll it back to fetching them by default, since
  in most cases (where tags are never deleted or re-pointed) it's not an
  issue to include them.

  To disable fetching of tags, configure \code{clean_tags: true} in
  \reference{get-step-params}.

  Thanks for the PR, \ghuser{mdomke}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \reference{component-atc} can now be configured with a global default
  \reference{job-build-logs-to-retain}, thanks to a PR by
  \ghuser{aeijdenberg}! This is useful for operators who want more control
  over their database usage.

  A maximum value can also be configured to ensure users don't just set it to
  9 trillion. The flags are \code{--default-build-logs-to-retain} and
  \code{--max-build-logs-to-retain}.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a memory leak in the \reference{component-tsa} introduced in
  \ghrelease{v3.11.0}.
}

\note{feature}{
  The \reference{fly-set-pipeline} command will no longer prompt \code{apply
  configuration?} if there are no changes to apply.
}

\note{feature}{
  There's a \reference{fly-order-pipelines} command now, for setting the
  order of pipelines.
}

\note{feature}{
  A \reference{fly-status} command has been added for checking whether or not
  you're logged in to the given target.
}

\note{feature}{
  When \reference{fly-check-resource} fails, it'll bubble up the error
  message rather than just saying error code \code{500}.
}

\note{fix}{
  Work around an apparent regression/behavior change in recent versions of
  Chrome that prevented the pipeline UI jobs from being clickable.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a corner case in error handling that could cause a lock to be held
  forever when detecting new versions of resource types. This could lead to
  things like builds stuck in "pending" state. Thanks to \ghuser{SHyx0rmZ}
  for the PR!
}

\note{fix}{
  When directed to the login page from the resource page, you will now be
  redirected back to where you were, rather than to the moon.
}

\note{fix}{
  The \code{concourse web} command is now capable of running the migration
  flags (\code{--current-db-version} and friends). It's still super janky
  (it'll run the \reference{component-tsa} alongside your...migrations), but
  hey, it runs them now.

  We'll probably clean this up in the future by having the migration stuff be
  a separate command instead.
}

\note{fix}{
  \reference{fly-cli} will once again helpfully instruct you to log in rather
  than just saying \code{error: forbidden}.
}

\note{feature}{
  The BOSH release now supports properties for configuring the new AWS
  Secrets Manager credential backend. Thanks for the PR, \ghuser{x6j8x}!
}

\note{feature}{
  When a previously-created volume disappears from a worker and the ATC tries
  to use it, the error message will now include the worker name and the
  volume handle. Thanks for the PR, \ghuser{rfliam}!
}

\note{fix}{
  The \reference{fly-check-resource} command will now fail more clearly when
  the resource's type is not found. Thanks to \ghuser{jmcarp} for the PR!
