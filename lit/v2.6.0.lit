\note{feature}{
  Workers will now, by default, wait for builds to finish before exiting.
  This will make it safer to perform a rolling update of a Concourse cluster.

  If you're running a BOSH deployment, this feature will just start happening
  automatically. If you're running the binary distribution or Docker, you'll
  need to invoke \code{land-worker} (for a temporary in-place update, i.e.
  preserving containers and volumes) or \code{retire-worker} (for a permanent
  exit) to initiate draining, and then wait for the worker process to exit.

  More docs on this are forthcoming; this release was expedited by the
  \resource{time} bug, so docs are sparse at the moment.

\note{feature}{
  Workers that have not heartbeated in a while will now enter a
  \code{stalled} state rather than just disappearing. This should improve
  resilience to network blips and makes the worker lifecycle much more
  explicit, allowing us to distinguish between accidentally-unavailable
  workers and intentionally-removed workers. This way we can continue to
  retry and wait for the worker to return.

  New workloads will not be placed on \code{stalled} workers. Stalled workers
  that will not be coming back can be cleaned up with the new command,
  \reference{fly-prune-worker}.

\note{fix}{
  The \resource{time} did not know to compare years. Yep. Pretty silly. So
  any interval triggers stopped triggering. Time is hard.

\note{feature}{
  Fly learned the \reference{fly-logout} command, which can be used to forget
  a target and its token. This is thanks to a PR by \ghuser{mkreibe}!
}

\note{feature}{
  Fly learned the \reference{fly-validate-pipeline} command, which can be
  used to...validate a pipeline. It does this without needing an external
  server, either, making it handy for quick local verification or automated
  testing.

  This was a PR submitted by \ghuser{jmcarp} - thanks!
}

\note{feature}{
  Previously if you configured a job with multiple \reference{get-step}s with
  the same name, the job would never be able to schedule. \ghuser{cnelson}
  did a PR to add a validation for this borked configuration
  - thanks!
}

\note{feature}{
  \reference{fly-cli} should now support colors on Windows, thanks to a PR
  from \ghuser{alex-slynko}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The BOSH release was changed to default Baggageclaim to consuming (disk
  size - 5GB), which was all fine and good until your disk was <= 5GB, which
  caused it to fail. It will now use the full 5GB. Though...you should
  probably just get more GBs.
}

\note{feature}{
  Resource checking can now be directed at a tagged worker by specifying
  \reference{resource-tags} on the resource.
