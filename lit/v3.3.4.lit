\note{fix}{
  A migration introduced in \ghrelease{v3.3.0} would load all the builds into
  memory and then process them, causing a lot of issues when upgrading. We 
  optimized this migration to migrate build plans in batches, rather than all
  at once.
}
\note{fix}{
  The \code{unpack} support for the \resource{s3} will no longer load the entire
  archive into memory, so it can be used for larger archives, thanks to a PR by
  \ghuser{krishicks}!
