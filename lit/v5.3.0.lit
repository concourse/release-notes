\release-version{5.3.0}

\note{feature}{
  \ghuser{rliebz} added the ability for \code{put} steps to
  \resource{git}s with the parameter \code{merge: true} to be further configured
  with the parameter \code{returning: unmerged}, which will ensure that
  concurrent changes to the same remote branch do not affect downstream jobs
  \ghpr{262}{git-resource}.
}

\note{feature}{
  Added the option for the
  \link{BOSH Backup and Restore}{https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/} database
  backup job in the
  \link{BOSH release}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-release} to be
  configured via a \link{BOSH link}{https://bosh.io/docs/links/}
  \ghpr{29}{concourse-bosh-release}, \ghpr{35}{concourse-bosh-release}.
}

\note{fix}{
  \ghuser{palixthepalalix} fixed a
  \link{bug}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3794} in the
  \resource{git} where commits
  from extraneous branches could appear in the version history if a tag filter
  was specified \ghpr{261}{git-resource}.
}

\note{fix}{
  Made the Concourse worker process systemd-aware. This
  fixed a subtle \link{bug}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3613}
  introduced in \ghrelease{v5.0.0} that could, on rare occasions, cause
  \link{container limits}{https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html#task-container-limits}
  not to be enforced or prevent containers from being killed
  \ghpr{24}{concourse-bosh-release}, \ghpr{31}{concourse-bosh-release}.

  Thanks to \ghuser{bodymindarts} for contributing to this effort.
}

\note{fix}{
  Addressed a bug where in rare circumstances, \code{fly intercept -c} would
  find multiple check containers for the same resource \ghpr{3983}.
}

\note{fix}{
  In service of a
  \link{refactor}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3811},
  \link{task caches}{https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html#caches}
  are now decoupled from the worker(s) they are stored on. As a result, you may
  find that in multi-worker deployments, pipelines making use of task caches
  may consume duplicate storage across workers
  \ghpr{3830}, \ghpr{3965}.
}

\note{fix}{
  Corrected a
  \link{surprising behaviour}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3957}
  where, when a pipeline was paused for an extended period of time, many of its
  resources' versions would disappear \ghpr{3963}.
}

\note{feature}{
  \ghuser{stigtermichiel} tuned our build process so that the size of the
  compressed frontend code is reduced by a factor of 3 - page loads should be
  accordingly faster \ghpr{3915}.
}

\note{fix}{
  There was a long-standing
  \link{bug}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1710} on the
  dashboard, where the existence of circular pipelines would cause the browser
  to crash. This was fixed in \ghrelease{v5.2.0}, but the fix caused a
  \link{performance regression}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3748},
  which is now also fixed \ghpr{3870}, \ghpr{3901}.
}

\note{feature}{
  If you want your web node to accept encrypted connections over HTTPS, you now
  have the option of connecting to an
  \link{ACME server}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment}
  to automatically retrieve a certificate from an ACME server of your choice. By
  default it will reach the free public ACME service provided by
  \link{Let's Encrypt}{https://letsencrypt.org/}.

  Thanks to \ghuser{henderjm} for the PR \ghpr{3878}!
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a \link{bug}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3814},
  introduced in \ghrelease{v5.1.0}, where, on a build step with
  \link{\code{attempts:}}{https://concourse-ci.org/attempts-step-modifier.html}
  specified, only one attempt would be possible to view on the build page
  \ghpr{3898}.
}

\note{fix}{
  \ghuser{gaelL} Fixed a
  \link{bug}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3549}, which had
  existed since at least \ghrelease{v4.2.3}, where operators were prevented from
  retiring team-scoped workers with the \code{concourse retire-worker} command
  \ghpr{3929}.
