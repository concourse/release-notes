\release-version{4.2.3}
\release-garden-runc-version{1.18.2}

\note{fix,security}{
  This release bumps our Garden-runC dependency to v1.18.2 which fixes
  \link{CVE 2019-5736}{https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5736}.
  \bold{We recommend that you upgrade your Concourse cluster to v4.2.3 to
  prevent this exploit from occurring.}

  Concourse relies on Garden-runC to create containers for executing jobs and
  resource checks in pipelines. By default, all containers created by
  Concourse are unprivileged, and should be safe from CVE 2019-5736.

  However, if your pipelines configure
  \reference{task-step-privileged}{\code{privileged: true}} on tasks or
  \reference{resource-type-privileged}{\code{privileged: true}} on resource
  types in your pipelines, these containers will be privileged, exposing the
  worker to the attack vector described in CVE 2019-5736. One common example
  of this is the \resource{docker-image}, which is always privileged.
}

\note{fix}{
  The \reference{cf-uaa-auth} connector has been updated to use the
  \code{authorization_endpoint} so that the authentication flow can be
  completed successfully. Previously, authentication flows would fail
  whenever a third-party SAML redirect is required.
