\note{feature}{
  The build page will now render exotic ANSI text modes like faint text,
  framed text (...?), and... Fraktur (??????).

  This is a feature, but I'll be damned if it's what makes us go to 3.10.

  If you're wondering what Fraktur looks like, check out the \link{pull
  request}{https://github.com/concourse/web/pull/2}. Thanks,
  \ghuser{evanphx}!

  If you're wondering why that's a standard, keep wondering.
}

\note{fix}{
  We've optimized the rendering of the build page, which got quite a bit
  slower with the introduction of timestamps in \ghrelease{v3.6.0}. There is
  more work to do here, but we've added performance tests to catch any future
  egregious regressions.
}

\note{fix}{
  The BOSH release's \code{credhub.client_id} and
  \code{credhub.client_secret} properties are now respected once again.
  Ironically this broke when we added CredHub testing to our pipeline, but in
  a way that avoided UAA client ID/secret configuration as it was much too
  heavyweight (hence the introduction of TLS auth properties).
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a BOSH release template resolution error from an undefined \code{esc}
  method, which would only occur on a clean deploy thanks to the magic of
  global state. This is an example of why using Ruby to generate Bash scripts
  is a terrible idea.

  Thanks to \ghuser{calebwashburn} for discovering the issue and PR-ing a
  fix!
}

\note{fix}{
  Cleaned up those pesky \code{atc.skymarshal.user.not-authorized} logs.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a crash that would occur when a \reference{task-step} configured
  \reference{task-step-image} but no \reference{task-step-config} or
  \reference{task-step-file}.
}

\note{fix}{
  The \reference{fly-cli}{\code{fly} CLI} will now buffer output when
  rendering tables, which should make things a bit faster on Windows.
