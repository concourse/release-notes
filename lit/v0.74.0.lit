\release-version{0.74.0}
\release-garden-linux-version{0.334.0}

\note{feature}{
  You can now \reference{resource-types}{configure resource types in your
  pipeline} rather than redeploying your workers with additional resource
  types. This should make it much easier to use the
  \reference{community-resources}{community resources} that people have
  built!
}

\note{feature}{
  Autoscroll on a build page is back and is now implemented in a way that
  doesn't kill the browser when you have many build events.
}

\note{feature}{
  If the Docker image you specify in the \reference{image_resource} section
  of your task has a custom user then we will now respect that when running
  the task. This user will also be used when hijacking in to a build
  container.
}

\note{feature}{
  Hijacked connections will no longer cause connection timeouts at interim
  load balancers if there is no input or output.
}

\note{feature}{
  The pipeline graph rendering now has large portions of the computation
  cached. This should provide a significant speedup and decrease in CPU load
  when viewing a pipeline.
}

\note{feature}{
  We've made some tweaks to the ATC's build scheduling that should fix
  "deadlock" scenarios with serial groups.

  Previously, if a pipeline of "A -> B -> C" had all 3 jobs in a serial
  group, and the builds were enqueued in order of C, B, then A (manually),
  nothing could ever run, as the scheduling was based on the order of the
  builds being enqueued, and C would never be satisifed. This is now fixed by
  collecting inputs and then scheduling only once they're available, so that
  C never gets scheduled, and so A is able to be scheduled, followed by B,
  and then C.
}

\note{fix}{
  The icon font that was broken in Safari by v0.73.0 are now unbroken by
  v0.74.0.
}

\note{fix}{
  Interrupting a \code{fly execute} that was fetching outputs will no longer
  panic if you cancel it in the middle.
}

\note{feature}{
  If you try and trigger a build while you are not logged in then we'll now
  redirect you back to the build page you were on rather than the main
  pipeline page.
}

\note{feature}{
  The \link{Pool resource}{https://github.com/concourse/pool-resource}
  will now ignore in-place modifications when working out if a log aquisition
  is still valid.
}

\note{feature}{
  \reference{fly-cli} will now print the target it will be interacting with
  at the start of every command.
}

\note{breaking}{
  \reference{fly-cli} default value of the \code{-t} flag has been removed.
  If you're using the VirtualBox distribution then you'll need to start
  logging in and supplying a target. This is to get people in this habit
  before they progress to a bigger deployment.
}

\note{feature}{
  \reference{fly-cli} has a more sensible timeout and a better error message
  if it cannot reach the targeted Concourse.
}

\note{feature}{
  We bumped to Go 1.6. You should see absolutely no change.
}
