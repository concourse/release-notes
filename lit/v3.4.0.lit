\release-date{2017-8-15}
\release-version{3.4.0}
\release-garden-runc-version{1.6.0}

\note{feature}{
  We've deprecated our \code{concourse/lite} Vagrant box in favor of a
  \code{bosh create-env} flow. This will be much easier for us to maintain
  and brings a lot more flexibility around configuring and upgrading
  Concourse.
}

\note{feature}{
  We've parallelized garbage collection. This should make things more durable
  to a slow worker, and make it harder for containers and volumes to "pile
  up" when the ATC is out of service briefly (i.e. during a deploy).

}

\note{feature}{
  The legend on the pipeline page will now auto-hide after 10 seconds.
}

\note{feature}{
  When switiching between pipelines, the UI will now fit the pipeline in view.
}

\note{feature}{
  You can also press 'F' to \strike{pay respects} center a pipeline in view.
}

\note{feature}{
  You can now log in with a personal access token when logging into a team
  with github auth, thanks to a PR by \ghuser{Chumper}!
}

\note{feature}{
  You can now set \reference{image-resource-version} on an
  \reference{image_resource}, thanks to a PR by \ghuser{krishicks}!
}

\note{fix}{
  We've removed the volume size column from \reference{fly-cli} ...
  previously it was always empty and no one seemed to care.
}

\note{fix}{
  The \reference{fly-validate-pipeline} command can now be provided with
  variables in the same way that \reference{fly-set-pipeline} can, thanks to
  a PR by \ghuser{jmcarp}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{bosh-deployment} now uses the latest BOSH CLI, thanks to a PR
  by \ghuser{selzoc}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{semver} now supports Server Side Encryption, thanks to a PR
  by \ghuser{miromode}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{git} will now save the committer email to `.git/committer`,
  thanks to a PR by \ghuser{knifhen}!
}

\note{feature}{
  Jobs with a pending build now have a static halo to better represent its
  waiting state, thanks to a PR by \ghuser{d}!
}

\note{feature}{
  \reference{fly-cli} learned the \reference{fly-format-pipeline} command,
  thanks to a PR by \ghuser{krishicks}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \reference{fly-abort-build} command can now abort by build ID, thanks
  to a PR by \ghuser{kurtmc}!
}

\note{feature}{
  BaggageClaim's response header timeout is now configurable, which should
  help those with large images that they're using for privileged tasks. This
  is a band-aid; we'll soon be making the API this is relevant to async.
}

\note{fix}{
  Files with the \code{setuid} and \code{setgid} permissions set on them will
  no longer have them removed. This used to be lost with the \code{chown}
  performed for namespacing the files. We'll now restore it after the
  \code{chown}.
}

\note{fix}{
  The flags for configuring GitLab oAuth are now present in
  \reference{fly-set-team}.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed an underflow in BaggageClaim's volume size detection, thanks to a PR
  by \ghuser{SHyx0rmZ}! This affected deployments with less than 10GB of
  space. (Psst: you should probably get more anyway.)
