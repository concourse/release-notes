\note{feature}{
  When connectivity to Concourse is lost on the pipeline page, a fancy
  warning message will be shown.

  This started as a PR from \ghuser{fmy} - thanks!
}

\note{feature}{
  Loading the logs of a build is now much faster (up to 12x improvements have
  been observed). Rendering performance is unchanged, but we found that for
  chatty builds the bulk of the time was spent simply downloading the logs.
}

\note{feature}{
  We will now only fetch a given resource (including
  \reference{image_resource}) once per worker. Previously they would all
  fetch concurrently and each populate the cache, which would storm the
  worker with network traffic and CPU load. Now one will start fetching and
  the rest will wait.
}

\note{feature}{
  We will no longer create no-op containers for cache hits. This should
  reduce the number of overall containers used by the pipeline.
}

\note{fix}{
  The build view was only showing the last 100 builds. And none of you
  noticed! It'll show all of'em now.
}

\note{fix}{
  BOSH-deployed workers' names will be set to their BOSH instance ID, rather
  than their hostname. This should make identifying them a bit easier.
}

\note{fix}{
  The \resource{docker-image} will now correctly handle private registry URIs
  without their port included.
}

\note{fix}{
  We now limit the total number of database connections to 64 per ATC, and
  have removed a debugging utility that led to deadlocks when a connection
  limit was reached (and also may have led to those connection limits being
  reached in the first place).
