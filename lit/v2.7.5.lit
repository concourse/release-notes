\note{feature,breaking}{
  The ATC can now be configured to emit metrics directly to InfluxDB. We've
  also made it easy to extend the ATC with support for more metrics emitters.
  For examples to reference when implementing your own, see the
  \link{InfluxDB}{https://github.com/concourse/atc/blob/master/metric/emitter/influxdb.go},
  \link{Lager}{https://github.com/concourse/atc/blob/master/metric/emitter/lager.go},
  and
  \link{Riemann}{https://github.com/concourse/atc/blob/master/metric/emitter/riemann.go}
  emitters.

  Note that if you switch from an "ATC -> Riemann -> InfluxDB" stack to "ATC
  -> InfluxDB" (direct), you'll have to blow away your metrics database. :(
  This is because when Riemann emitted our metrics it emitted the values as
  \link{\code{float}}{http://media0.giphy.com/media/13AU33EspJuPTy/giphy.gif},
  and now they're \code{int}. The first point emitted to InfluxDB determines
  the schema, so the new writes do not succeed.

  Also note that if you were previously relying on the metrics being emitted
  to the logs, you'll now need to pass the flag \code{--emit-to-logs}. This
  is now modeled as its own metric emitter and has been made opt-in, as
  otherwise it could just be producing a lot of useless logs if you've
  already configured a metrics sink or just don't care.

\note{feature}{
  The ATC will now retry connecting to Postgres when the server-side
  connection limit is reached. It uses fancy Exponential Backoff Technologyâ„¢.
}

\note{fix}{
  Upgrading from \ghrelease{v2.7.0} to any of the previous releases would
  leave the user in a broken state until they logged out and back in. It
  would show that you're logged in, but any actions taken (e.g. pausing a job
  or triggering a build) would silently fail. They will now send the user to
  the log-in page instead.
}

\note{fix}{
  Previously, with multiple tabs open, logging in to one tab would leave the
  other tabs in a weird half-logged-in state (due to our CSRF security fix).
  It should now...not do that.

  To the user this may have appeared as being prematurely logged out, because
  no one really keeps track of which tab is which. We suspect this is the
  actual root cause.
}

\note{fix}{
  We've bumped Garden-runC to 1.6.0 which fixes a regression that caused
  \code{/etc/hosts} and \code{/etc/resolv.conf} to be unmodifiable.
