\note{fix}{
  Fixed a race condition during volume creation for worker base resource
  types. This would result in resource actions failing with \code{failed to
  create volume}.

  Unfortunately, to propagate this fix you'll need to recreate your workers,
  as they're in a broken state.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed the reporting of database query metrics.
