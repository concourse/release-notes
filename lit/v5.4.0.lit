\release-version{5.4.0}

\note{feature,breaking}{
  We have switched to a more efficient algorithm for streaming volumes between
  various components of the system - the \code{web} and \code{worker} nodes now
  transmit volumes compressed with the
  \link{Zstandard}{https://facebook.github.io/zstd/} algorithm rather than
  \link{\code{Gzip}}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip} - \code{fly} is
  affected, too (when uploading/downloading artifacts during
  \code{fly execute}). We're hoping this will resolve some general complaints
  of steps being slow to start or appearing to "hang" in clustered environments.
  \bold{note:} this will require upgrading your workers \ghpr{3880}.
}

\note{feature}{
  Because of the efficiency gained from employing Zstandard compression to
  volume streaming, the CPU on the web and worker nodes is no longer a limiting
  factor. Now volumes will be streamed over multiple parallel connections,
  and we have seen some very exciting improvements in the time taken to
  initialize build steps. You can see some of our measurements in the discussion
  on
  \link{this issue}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3992}
  \ghpr{3993}.
}

\note{feature,breaking}{
  On the build page all steps are now collapsed by default. This means that the
  build page loads faster, but if you want to watch the logs in real time, you
  will need to click on the header of the running step \ghpr{4058}.
}

\note{fix}{
  The BOSH Backup and Restore job for the database now works properly if you
  provide your database configuration via a BOSH link. Before, it would always
  use a hardcoded default if you didn't explicitly specify, causing BOSH links
  to be ignored \ghpr{41}{concourse-bosh-release}.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a regression found recently involving
  \link{momentum based scrolling}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3956}
  on build pages on iOS browsers 
  The fix was also applied to the sidebar and the dashboard \ghpr{4050}
}

\note{feature}{
  \ghuser{maryamklabib} optimized the \resource{pool} - \code{check} and
  \code{in} scripts will run faster by using shallow cloning
  \pr{49}{pool-resource}.
}

\note{fix}{
  \ghuser{cappyzawa} fixed an issue where the \resource{s3} would break when
  \link{\code{disable_multipart: true}}{https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource#source-configuration}
  was set in the source configuration, and a tracked file was smaller than the
  minimum upload part size for the configured s3-compatible blobstore
  \ghpr{131}{s3-resource}.
}

\note{feature}{
  Improved the appearance of the sidebar (re-introduced in \ghrelease{v5.2.0})
  in response to
  \link{user feedback}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3872}.
  Teams and pipelines are now easier to distinguish, and there are nicely styled
  tooltips for long items \ghpr{4032}.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a \link{bug}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3803} where,
  if your local machine is running Mac or Linux and you run \code{fly execute}
  with \code{--input} against a cluster with a mix of Linux and Windows workers,
  your files could get uploaded to a Windows worker, where ther permission
  metadata would be stripped off. Now \code{fly execute} makes sure
  only to upload user artifacts to workers matching the
  \link{\code{platform}}{https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html#task-platform}
  of the task being executed \ghpr{4066}.
}

\note{fix}{
  \ghuser{cappyzawa} fixed up \code{fly} to behave like a sensible Unix tool
  when passing the \code{-h} or \code{--help} flag: it now prints the usage text
  on \code{stdout} and returns a successful status code \ghpr{4064}.
}

\note{fix}{
  \ghuser{cappyzawa} fixed a small issue where the \code{-j} or \code{--json}
  flag was not honored when running
  \link{\code{fly get-team}}{https://concourse-ci.org/managing-teams.html#fly-get-team}
  \ghpr{4046}.
}

\note{fix}{
  \ghuser{robwhitby} fixed an
  \link{issue}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/4005} where
  re-checking a resource would cause the metadata from its latest version to be
  erased \ghpr{4028}.
}

\note{feature}{
  \ghuser{deadNightTiger} added a
  \link{\code{fly completion}}{https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html#fly-completion}
  subcommand that allows \code{fly} to output autocompletion for the \code{bash}
  and \code{zsh} shells \ghpr{4012}.
}

\note{feature}{
  When you manually trigger a build through the web UI, the 'prep' section at
  the top of the build page now shows a spinner on the entries marked
  "discovering new versions of..." while the resource checks are in progress.
  As the checks resolve, the spinners will become checkmarks, so you'll have a
  better sense of what might be holding up your build \ghpr{3970}.
}

\note{feature}{
  When you abort a pending build before it gets scheduled, the build page will
  now report it as 'cancelled' instead of showing a loading spinner forever
  \ghpr{3922}.
}

\note{feature}{
  the CSS optimizer used in building the web UI was upgraded, so the resulting
  CSS is slightly smaller, which should result in some faster page loads
  \ghpr{4004}.
}
