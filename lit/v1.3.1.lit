\note{fix}{
  Bumping Buildroot brought in \code{git} version 2.8.2, which breaks
  handling of nested submodules. We've moved ahead to master of Buildroot
  which bumps \code{git} to 2.8.3, which should fix the issue.
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{github-release} resource will now retry on failed uploads, up
  to 10 times.
}

\note{fix}{
  The build numbers made in automated commits to the \resource{pool} are now
  escaped with backticks so that GitHub doesn't auto-link them to bogus
  issues. Thanks \ghuser{geramirez}!
