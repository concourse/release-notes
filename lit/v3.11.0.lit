\warn{

  \ghissue{2165}. The severity of the memory leak will be different based on the
  size of your deployment and the types of workloads you run on it.
}
\note{fix,breaking}{
  The \resource{git} will no longer have tags present in the fetched repo,
  thanks to a PR by \ghuser{benmoss}.

  They are now cleared out after the fetch, because the state of all tags is
  prone to change after the initial fetch, as the resource's source of truth
  is \italic{commits}. So after the fetch, the cache would have an
  out-of-date view of the tags, which could lead to problems when pushing.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a bug in the BOSH release that prevented the \reference{worker-node}s
  from starting in a fresh deploy. Sorry about that. Thanks \ghuser{z4ce} for
  the PR!

\note{feature}{
  The \code{/dashboard} page looks better on phones now.

\note{feature}{
  The \code{/dashboard} page makes way fewer requests now, so it's a lot
  faster to load and more efficient to periodically refresh.
}

\note{feature}{

  pipeline (\code{-p}), thanks to a PR by \ghuser{andrewedstrom}!

\note{feature}{
  There's a new credential manager in town for AWS's newly-launched
  \link{Secrets Manager}{https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/} (not to be
  confused with \link{Systems
  Manager}{https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/systems-manager/}, which is
  also used for managing secrets). Thanks \ghuser{x6j8x} for the PR!

  We realize that we now have two undocumented credential managers, one
  called AWS SSM and one called AWS SM. We like to call this "hard mode".
  (Sorry, we'll backfill docs soon.)
}

\note{feature}{
  The \reference{vault-credential-manager} can now be configured with a
  \code{--vault-auth-backend-max-ttl}, after which it will force a re-login.
  Thanks \ghuser{baptiste-bonnaudet} for the PR!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \reference{vault-credential-manager} will now retry with exponential
  backoff when logging in, rather than retrying every second.

  span multiple days (e.g. 10AM - 5AM), thanks to a PR by \ghuser{jleben}!

  \code{.git/commit_message}, thanks to a PR by \ghuser{elgohr}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \reference{web-node} can now be configured with \code{--cookie-secure}

  \ghuser{jmcarp}!

  The \resource{github-release} now supports a \code{tag_filter}
  configuration for matching arbitrary semver tags, thanks to a PR from
  \ghuser{jmcarp}!
}

\note{fix}{
  Added a missing property to the BOSH release for configuring a CA cert for
  \reference{generic-oauth}. Thanks for the PR, \ghuser{youngm}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{docker-image} now supports configuring
  \code{aws_session_token}, thanks to a PR by \ghuser{itsdalmo}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{docker-image} now has yet another new param,
  \code{cache_from}, thanks to a PR by \ghuser{dhinus}!

  This new param is like \code{load_bases} except everything loaded will also
  be used as a cache during the build.
}

\note{fix}{
  The \resource{git} will now recover from a deleted tag when configured with
  \code{tag_filter}, thanks to a PR by \ghuser{ljfranklin}!
}

  strict with your YAML, thanks to a PR by \ghuser{aeijdenberg}!
}

  The \resource{cf} now supports \code{verbose: true}, which will tell the
  CLI to dump trace logs to the output. Thanks for the PR,
  \ghuser{JohannesRudolph}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{docker-image} now supports a \code{target_name} param for

\note{feature}{
  The BOSH release now bakes in the glue code for use with \link{BOSH Backup
  and
  Restore}{https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore},
  thanks to a PR by \ghuser{rkoster}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \reference{fly-set-pipeline} command can now be given \code{--no-color}
  flag to strip out the color from the diffs. Instead of using color,
  \code{+} and \code{-} will be at the start of added and removed lines.
}

\note{feature}{
  Now that we're building with Go 1.10+, \reference{fly} will respect socks5
  proxies configured via the "standard" \code{http_proxy}/\code{https_proxy}
  env vars.
