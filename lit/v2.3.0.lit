\note{feature}{
  The whole UI now runs as a single Elm app! Pages should load much quicker,
  and the pipeline sidebar now remains open as you navigate around.

  There's still some UX work to be done to make things a big smoother, e.g.
  better handling for 404 cases and more consistent loading indicators, but
  this is the first big step on that path.
