\note{feature}{
  Teams can now be destroyed via \reference{fly-destroy-team}.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a hairy deadlock that could lead to jobs getting stuck "waiting for a
  suitable set of input versions". We fixed it, like, really hard. Like the
  lock isn't even THERE anymore, man. (And it's not needed anymore, either.
  That's important too.)
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{cf} now has the latest CLI version again. Unbeknownst to us,
  the CLI team switched buckets, so we stopped getting new bits.
}

\note{fix}{
  We've fixed the CLI download links on the "no pipelines" page.
}

\note{fix}{
  The fallback flow in \code{login} for accepting the token manually is now
  fixed, thanks to a PR from \ghuser{sharms}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{bosh-io-stemcell} will now aggressively retry downloads,
  thanks to \ghuser{zachgersh} and \ghuser{ljfranklin}!
}

\note{feature}{
  The \resource{s3} now supports setting a \code{Content-Type} for the file
  being uploaded, thanks to a PR from \ghuser{pdelagrave}!
}
