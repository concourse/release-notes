\note{feature}{
  Due to popular demand, we're graduating the pipeline dashboard out of beta
  and back into \code{/dashboard}. You can now also do useful things like log
  in and click through to the normal pipeline and build pages.
}

\note{feature}{
  The NewRelic metrics emitter has now been improved thanks to
  \ghuser{novas0x2a}!
}

\note{fix}{
  Removed a pesky database constraint
  (\code{cannot_invalidate_during_initialization}). This would occasionally
  bubble up to the user in weird ways, and actually isn't necessary any more.
}

\note{fix}{
  The previous release snuck some code that wasn't quite ready yet into the
  BOSH release and broke registration of external workers. This is now fixed.
}

\note{fix}{
  Occasionally builds would fail when interacting with Vault with
  \code{http2: no cached connection was available}. NO LONGER! (We, uh, we
  bumped a dependency.)
}

\note{fix}{
  Certain ANSI cursor movement escape sequences would wreak havoc on the
  Concourse build output page because there was no window size set on the
  TTY, thus defaulting it to \code{80x24}. We've set it to \code{500x500}.
  That oughtta do it.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed an issue where Firefox users couldn't click around on the build page.
}
