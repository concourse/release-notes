\release-garden-runc-version{1.6.0}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a regression in the handling of \reference{put-step}s that have no
  inputs. Prior to \ghrelease{v3.0.0} we would ensure that the directory
  given to \code{/opt/resource/out} would exist even if there are no inputs,
  so that resources don't have to do a \code{mkdir -p}.

  We now once again ensure the directory exists, and have coverage to ensure
  this doesn't happen again.
}

\note{fix}{
  Fixed a regression in \reference{task-step}s causing their
  \reference{task-step-params} to not be set in the environment when
  hijacking. This got lost in a cleanup and is now handled in a much simpler
  way, and also tested so it doesn't regress again.
}

\note{fix}{
  The \reference{fly-set-pipeline} command will now exit 0 if the user bails
  out.
